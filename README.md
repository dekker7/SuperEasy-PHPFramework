=========

I did not know how to name this repo that is why it has this random name. :)

This is a super simple MVC FrameWork, i build it and use it for rapid prototyping projects.

It has a router,library,model,view,controller and templates using only php. 

Bootstrap 3 and jquery 1.x are included. So is fontawesome, but that is linked to cdnjs.
